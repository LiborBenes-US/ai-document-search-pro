🚀 **The AI Knowledge Unification Problem Solved**

Traditional AI systems require sending your data to the cloud. **AI Document Search Pro** solves this by bringing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) capabilities **100% locally** to your computer.

What is RAG?
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines:
1. Retrieval: Finding relevant information in your documents (this app)
2. Generation: AI answering questions based on retrieved information (future enhancement)

This app is the complete Retrieval system: the essential foundation for any RAG pipeline.
